1. [Major] Did not implement the left-hand algorithm recursively 

This comment was made on solve_lefthand. I had started working on it before deciding to use a resubmit on this homework and complete this task later. When I returned to it, I completely redesigned my approach to this problem, making a new helper function 'go_left' on which solve_lefthand calls recursively. 

Because the work I originally submitted for this method was incomplete, the changes I made were more of a complete redesign than a limited tweaking of a few lines. 

Again, the affected methods are solve_lefthand() and left_navigate()
